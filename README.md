# evive_android_app
A simple android app to communicate with Evive (www.evive.cc) using the ESP-8266 module.
To get started:-
1. Download and extract the zip.
2. Open Android Studio on your device and import this project.
   (There might be some error messages like some packages are deprecated if you are using 6.0 or higher SDK and you would ask      to rebuild the gradle. Continue with the gradle rebuild.)
3. Make the changes like the directory your project is set.
4. Run the project/app on a real Android device. Emulators will load the app but it won't work as the device WiFi should          connect with the ESP8266 Wifi.
5. To use the app for simple experiments, further instructions are available at https://www.instructables.com/id/Control-Evive-Using-Android-Application-Over-WiFi/
